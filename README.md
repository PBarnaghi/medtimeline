# medtimeline

The MedTimeline library aims to provide a standardised process for pre-processing and generating patient journey timelines for the cardiology dataset.

The following provides an overview on how to use the library to:

Configure the library based on your own data paths and computer set up
Load patient journeys based on individual RDVs
Load pre-processed RDVs, without generating timelines
Load combined patient journeys based on procedure RDVs
Load pre-processed, individual procedure-related RDVs, without generating timelines
Load complete, full patient journeys, for all admissions, based on all RDVs.
Timeline are a useful step in large language modelling and can be used for various research purposes.
